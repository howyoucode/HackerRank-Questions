# 1. Python: Average Function
### Implement a function that:

- Is named avg

- Takes a variable number of integer arguments; it is guaranteed that at least one argument will be passed

- Returns the average value of the passed arguments as a float

 

The implementation will be tested by a provided code stub on several input files. Each input file contains one line with space-separated arguments for the function. The function will be called with those arguments, and the returned result will be printed to the output with exactly `2` decimal places.

 

### Example:

`3` arguments are read and passed to the function: `1, 2`, and `3`. The average is calculated to be `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.00`. This is then returned as a float to be printed.

 

### Constraints:

- `1` ≤ number of arguments for the function `≤ 100`

- `-100` ≤ value of passed arguments `≤ 100`

  <summary><strong>Input Format Format for Custom Testing</strong></summary>

  In the first and only line, there are space-separated integers that denote the values to be passed to the function.

### Sample Input
| STDIN | Function |
|----------|----------|
| 2 5 | arguments = [2, 5] |
 

### Sample Output

`3.50`
 

### Explanation:

The function will be called with 2 arguments having values 2 and 5. The average of those numbers is 3.5. This value is returned and will be printed to the output with 2 decimal places.

   <summary><strong>Sample Case 1</strong></summary>

### Sample Input
| STDIN | Function |
|-----|-----|
| 7 | arguments = 7 |
 

### Sample Output

`7.00`
 

### Explanation:

The function will be called with 1 argument with the value 7. The average of one number is the number itself, so 7.0 is returned in this case. That value will be printed to the output with 2 decimal places.
